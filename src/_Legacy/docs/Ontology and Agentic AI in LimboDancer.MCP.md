# Ontology and Agentic AI in LimboDancer.MCP

## What is Ontology

Ontology, in the context of AI and systems like LimboDancer.MCP, is a structured way of defining and organizing knowledge. It provides a formal vocabulary of concepts (such as entities, relationships, and properties) and rules for how these concepts interconnect. By establishing a shared semantic framework, ontology ensures that different components—humans, AI agents, and services—interpret and reason about information consistently. This enables more effective search, reasoning, and coordination across distributed systems, forming the backbone for truly agentic AI.

## Why Ontology Matters

Agentic AI systems need more than raw embeddings or search indices — they require **shared semantics** that bind:

* **Tools** to formal input/output schemas.
* **Memories** to entities and relationships.
* **Plans** to preconditions and effects grounded in state.
* **Governance** to enforce rules and constraints.

An ontology provides this layer, enabling **reasoning, planning, validation, and governance**.

## Core Concepts

| Concept             | Role in LimboDancer.MCP                          | Backed By                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Ontology**        | JSON-LD context defining classes, properties     | `/src/LimboDancer.MCP.Ontology` |
| **Taxonomy**        | Lightweight categorical hierarchies              | AI Search filters               |
| **Schema**          | Shapes for EF Core entities and MCP tool schemas | EF Core, JSON Schema            |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Instances + relationships, used for reasoning    | Cosmos DB Gremlin               |
| **Governance**      | SHACL-like constraints, rule enforcement         | Ontology validators in code     |

## Ontology in the LimboDancer.MCP Design

From [`LimboDancer.MCP.md`](./LimboDancer.MCP.md):

* **First-class project:** `LimboDancer.MCP.Ontology`
* **JSON-LD context:** CURIEs for entities like `ldm:Person`, `ldm:Trip`, `ldm:Reservation`, `ldm:Tool`.
* **Schemas:** EF Core and MCP tool schemas annotated with ontology URIs.
* **Preconditions/Effects:** Expressed in terms of graph queries and updates.
* **Governance:** Validators enforce type, property, and relational constraints before and after tool calls.

---

## Ontology Milestones in the Roadmap

From [`LimboDancer.MCP Roadmap.md`](./LimboDancer.MCP%20Roadmap.md):

* **Milestone 4 — Ontology v1:**
  JSON-LD context established, EF Core models mapped, and tools expose ontology-bound schemas.

* **Milestone 5 — Planner + Preconditions/Effects:**
  Ontology terms govern preconditions (checked in KG) and effects (committed to KG + history).
  
  #### Note: 
  The planner first resolves the active **OntologyStore** using `{tenant,package,channel}` and then evaluates preconditions/effects strictly within that scope. Tool invocations inherit the same scope; any cross‑tenant or cross‑channel reference is refused with a typed `scope_mismatch` error.

---

* **Milestone 6 — Knowledge Graph Integration:**
  Cosmos DB Gremlin stores ontology instances, enabling neighborhood expansion and typed queries.

* **Milestone 10 — Observability & Governance:**
  Ontology validators enforce SHACL-style rules, surfacing violations in the Blazor console.

## Practical Representations

1. **JSON-LD Contexts**
   Define shared URIs for all entities and properties. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "@context": {
       "ldm": "https://limbodancer.ai/ontology/",
       "Person": "ldm:Person",
       "owns": { "@id": "ldm:owns", "@type": "@id" }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Tool Schemas (Ontology-Bound)**

   ```json
   {
     "name": "cancelReservation",
     "inputSchema": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "reservationId": { "type": "string", "@id": "ldm:Reservation" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **KG Commit Example (Effect)**

   ```
   Tool: cancelReservation
   Effect: Reservation.status → Canceled
   Edge: Reservation -[statusChange]-> State(Canceled)
   ```

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Ontology drift** — schemas and KG must evolve in lockstep.
* **Over-engineering** — OWL/Reasoners not needed in hot path; stick to property graph + validators.
* **Implicit semantics** — always bind tool schemas and EF entities explicitly to ontology terms.

---

## 30-Day Starter Plan (Mapped to Roadmap)

1. **Week 1–2**

   * Draft JSON-LD context.
   * Define ontology terms for core entities (Session, Message, MemoryItem, Person, Trip).
   * Integrate into EF Core entity attributes.

2. **Week 2–3**

   * Annotate 3 initial MCP tools with ontology-bound schemas.
   * Add validators to enforce schema compliance.

3. **Week 3–4**

   * Ingest entities into Cosmos Gremlin.
   * Enable neighborhood expansion queries in retrieval pipeline.
   * Surface ontology entities in Blazor Console UI.

---

## Summary

Ontology is not an afterthought — it is the **semantic backbone** of LimboDancer.MCP.
By tying **Roadmap milestones** and **Design Map architecture** directly to ontology deliverables, we ensure:

* Tools remain **typed and composable**.
* Memories are **searchable and interpretable**.
* Plans are **governed by explicit rules**.
* Operators can **observe and validate ontology entities** in real time.

Would you like me to also prepare a **dedicated `Ontology.md` reference file** (separate from this conceptual doc) that catalogs all ontology terms (classes, properties, constraints) as they are introduced in Milestone 4 onward? That could serve as both a **developer glossary** and a **living contract** for the system.
