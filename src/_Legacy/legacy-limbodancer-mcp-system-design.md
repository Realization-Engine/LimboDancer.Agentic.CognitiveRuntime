# LimboDancer.MCP System Design (Legacy)

**Status:** Historical. Describes the legacy `LimboDancer.MCP` architecture archived in `src/_Legacy/`. Not current guidance.

**Current requirements:** The ASL reference-domain requirements and acceptance scenarios formerly at the top of this document are now maintained in [`src/ASL/docs/LimboDancer.Agentic.CognitiveRuntime ASL Reference-Domain Requirements.md`](<../ASL/docs/LimboDancer.Agentic.CognitiveRuntime ASL Reference-Domain Requirements.md>).

References to `LimboDancer.MCP` as the product, .NET 9, direct MCP tool execution, the old project layout, generalized plugins, legacy Planner/ReAct behavior, deployment topology, package versions, and implementation status describe the legacy system only.

## Executive Summary
LimboDancer.MCP is an ontology-first Model Context Protocol server that transforms complex documents—rulebooks, regulations, technical specifications—into queryable knowledge graphs, using Vector and Graph databases, enabling AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT to provide contextually-accurate answers about intricate rule systems. Built on .NET 9 and Azure, it extracts structured knowledge while preserving exact rule references (critical for domains like wargaming where "Rule A6.41" must remain unchanged), handles nested exceptions and cross-references, integrates spatial data through a plugin architecture (supporting hex-based wargames, grid-based RPGs, or custom coordinate systems), and maintains dynamic state tracking for scenarios where terrain changes or units move. The system combines graph traversal for precise rule relationships with vector search for semantic discovery, validates consistency across thousands of interconnected rules, and scales through multi-tenant isolation—turning 200-page PDFs that require expert interpretation into intelligent systems that can answer questions like "Can my elite infantry unit enter an enemy-occupied building?" by considering base rules, applicable exceptions, current game state, and spatial constraints. This system addresses the AI needs of vertical markets such as gaming (tabletop market $15B+), regulatory compliance, technical documentation, the legal profession, and any domain where complex conditional logic must be consistently applied, offering organizations the ability to democratize expert knowledge while ensuring accuracy and reducing costly rule interpretation errors.

## Overview and Purpose

LimboDancer.MCP is an **ontology-first** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built on **.NET 9** and **Azure**. As a full-featured MCP implementation, it provides tools for session management, memory storage, vector search, and knowledge graph operations. What distinguishes LimboDancer is its deep integration with formal ontologies - every tool, memory item, and graph entity is grounded in a typed semantic model. This enables the system to extract structured knowledge from complex documents (for instance rulesets, rulebooks, govt regulations or legal documents), maintain consistency across data stores, and provide contextually-aware responses to any MCP-compatible AI assistant, such as Claude and ChatGPT for instance.

### Example: Processing a Strategy Game Rulebook

When a user submits a board game rulebook (e.g., "Advanced Squad Leader"), LimboDancer:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Rulebook PDF] --> B[Document Ingestion]
    B --> C{Pattern Recognition}
    
    C --> D[Extract Entities]
    C --> E[Parse Rules]
    C --> F[Detect Exceptions]
    C --> G[Find Cross-References]
    
    D --> H[Ontology Store]
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H
    
    H --> I[Knowledge Graph]
    H --> J[Vector Index]
    
    K[User Query:<br/>'Can elite infantry enter<br/>enemy buildings?'] --> L[Query Engine]
    
    L --> I
    L --> J
    
    I --> M[Rule 7.4.2: No entry]
    I --> N[Exception: Elite units ignore 7.4.2]
    J --> O[Similar contexts]
    
    M --> P[Answer: Yes, elite units<br/>can enter due to exception]
    N --> P
    O --> P
```

1. **Extracts Ontology** - Identifies game entities (units, terrain, weapons), their properties (movement points, firepower), and relationships (line-of-sight rules, stacking limits)

2. **Captures Rule Structure** - Parses numbered rules (e.g., "7.4.2 Infantry may not enter building hexes occupied by enemy units"), creating queryable nodes with cross-references

3. **Handles Exceptions** - Detects special cases ("EXC: Elite units ignore rule 7.4.2") and links them to base rules with proper precedence

4. **Builds Knowledge Graph** - Creates a navigable structure where rules, exceptions, examples, and game states are interconnected

**Benefits**: Instead of searching through a 200-page PDF, users can ask contextual questions like "Can my elite infantry unit enter a building with enemies?" and receive accurate answers that consider all applicable rules, exceptions, and current game state. The system validates rule consistency and flags conflicts during ingestion.

## Architecture

### High-Level System Flow

    RS[Rulesets & Documents]
    API[OpenAPI Specs]
    MD[Map/Board Data]
  end
  
  subgraph "LimboDancer Core"

    ONT[Ontology Store]
    VAL[Validation Layer]
    QE[Query Engine]
    PS[Plugin System]
  end
  
  subgraph "Storage"

  MD --> RD
  EXT --> ONT
  ONT --> VAL
  VAL --> CS
  ONT --> QE
  QE --> AI
  QE --> PG
  QE --> PS
  PS --> RD
```

### Multi-Tenant Scope

Every operation is scoped by hierarchical partition keys:
- **Tenant** - Organization boundary
- **Package** - Module grouping (e.g., "rules", "core")
- **Channel** - Version stream (e.g., "current", "v1.0.0")

### Plugin Architecture

Domain-specific logic is isolated in plugins:
- **ASL Plugin** - Hex-based wargame spatial logic
- **D&D Plugin** - Grid-based RPG mechanics
- **Chess Plugin** - Algebraic notation and board logic
- **Generic Plugin** - Fallback for unstructured documents

---

## Core Ontology Components

### Enhanced Node Types (Phase 3)

1. **Entities** - Objects within the rules (units, tokens, game pieces, domain concepts)
2. **Properties** - Attributes and values (stats, costs, capabilities, with owner/range/cardinality)
3. **Relations** - Typed connections between elements (prerequisites, dependencies, typed edges)
4. **Enums** - Categorical values (states, types, phases, closed value sets)
5. **Shapes** - SHACL-like validation templates for data structures
6. **RuleNodes** - Primary rule statements with preserved canonical IDs (A.1, B.23.71)
7. **ExceptionNodes** - Rule modifications with precedence weights and nested support
8. **ConditionNodes** - Context-dependent rule activation and prerequisites
9. **ReferenceNodes** - Cross-rule linkages preserving exact rule IDs
10. **ExampleNodes** - Clarifying instances with location references validation
11. **DefinitionNodes** - CAPS terms with special meanings
12. **PhaseNodes** - Temporal containers for phase-specific rules
13. **MatrixRuleNodes** - Multi-dimensional rule tables (terrain charts)
14. **Aliases** - Canonical names + synonyms for robust matching

### Dynamic State Components

1. **HexState** - Tracks base and current terrain plus unit occupants
2. **Unit** - Dynamic game pieces with movement and LOS properties
3. **Counter** - Terrain modifiers (smoke, rubble, blazes)
4. **GameBoard** - Manages dynamic state overlay on pre-computed base data

---

## Extraction and Query Capabilities

### Enhanced Extraction Process (Phase 3)

The extraction engine identifies complex patterns:
- **Canonical Rule IDs** preserved exactly (A.1, B.23.71, 10.211)
- **Nested exceptions** with precedence chains (EXC within EXC)
- **Matrix rules** for terrain charts and combat tables
- **Location references** extracted from examples (3K3, P5)
- **Hierarchical rule structure** (10.211 → 10.21 → 10.2 → 10)
- **Module namespacing** (Part A, Part B, module-specific)

### Advanced Query Capabilities

**Structural Queries:**
- Rule hierarchy traversal using canonical IDs
- Exception precedence resolution
- Cross-module reference validation
- Matrix rule lookups

**Spatial Queries (via plugins):**
- Line of sight calculations
- Distance and adjacency checks
- Terrain modification effects
- Dynamic state queries

**Contextual Queries:**
- "Can infantry in woods at K3 see building at P5?"
- "What exceptions apply when elite units enter buildings?"
- "What are my options during Prep Fire Phase?"

### Reference Data Integration

- **Pre-computed LOS data** for performance
- **JSON document store** for map/hex data
- **Dynamic terrain modifications** (buildings→rubble, woods→blazes)
- **Unit movement tracking** with state enrichment

### Validation Layer

- **Rule ID format validation** (canonical ASL format)
- **Location reference validation** against board data
- **Exception precedence validation**
- **Module compatibility checking**
- **Circular dependency detection**
- **Terminology consistency** (CAPS terms)

### Graph vs Vector: Complementary Technologies

**LimboDancer.MCP.Graph.CosmosGremlin** stores **structured relationships**:
- Rule hierarchies with canonical IDs (e.g., "10.211" CHILD-OF "10.21")
- Exception chains with precedence weights
- Phase-based rule activation
- Cross-module references

**LimboDancer.MCP.Vector.AzureSearch** handles **semantic similarity**:
- Rule text with embeddings for meaning-based search
- Example text with location references
- Matrix rule content
- Hybrid search with ontology metadata

**How they work together with spatial plugins**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q[Query: Can tanks at 3K3<br/>cross river at 3K4?] --> QE[Query Engine]
    
    QE --> VS[Vector Search]
    QE --> GS[Graph Store]
    QE --> SP[Spatial Plugin]
    
    VS --> R1[Find river<br/>crossing rules]
    
    GS --> R2[Traverse: Tank<br/>→ Vehicle Rules<br/>→ Terrain Restrictions]
    
    SP --> R3[Check terrain<br/>at 3K4, calculate<br/>movement cost]
    
    R1 --> A[Combined Answer:<br/>Rules + Exceptions<br/>+ Spatial Context]
    R2 --> A
    R3 --> A
```

## Ontology Design and Implementation

### MCP Tool Interface

Enhanced tools for Phase 3 functionality:

```csharp
public class OntologyExtractionTool : IMcpTool
{
    public Task<OntologyGraph> ExtractOntology(
        string documentPath, 
        string systemType = "Generic")  // Plugin selection
    {
        // Preserves canonical rule IDs
        // Handles nested exceptions
        // Extracts matrix rules
    }
    
    public Task<QueryResult> Query(
        string ontologyId, 
        Query query)
    {
        // Uses appropriate spatial plugin
        // Enriches state with reference data
        // Handles dynamic terrain state
    }
}
```

  API[OpenAPI Specs] --> ING
  MAP[Map Data] --> REF[Reference Store]
  ING --> EXT[Extract with<br/>Pattern Recognition]
  EXT --> PRES[Preserve<br/>Canonical IDs]
  PRES --> REL[Build<br/>Relationships]
  REL --> VAL[Validate<br/>Cross-References]
  VAL --> PUB[Publish to<br/>Ontology]
  PUB --> SYNC[Sync with<br/>Spatial Plugins]
  REF --> SYNC
```
